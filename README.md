## Code Description
This application is built using React as well as the https://randomuser.me/ API in order to generate a list of employees. External dependencies that were needed include axios for fetching the API and bootstrap for styling.
## Installation
1. Clone the repository from https://github.com/riraq/Employee_Database.
2. Run "npm i" in the main directory of the application in order to install dependencies.
## Function
The user requested an application that allows them to sort and filter their employees in order to view their non-sensitive information. By clicking on the "Name" column header in the table, the list of employees becomes sorted by first name. When a name is searched in the search bar, only employees with a matching string anywhere in their first name will display. If the search bar is cleared, all employees are displayed again.
